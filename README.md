I'm highly intrigued by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the role it plays in solving customer problems.
I’m currently pursuing my Master's degree in AI.

I’m looking to collaborate and gain a better understanding of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and increase my competency and knowledge in this niche field. I seek to build intuition, gather valuable insights, build and recommend products, identify hidden patterns, and predict trends by leveraging artificial intelligence advancements.

I'm a Solution Designer by profession with 12 years of experience. I've designed and implemented world-class inventory management and workflow-orchestration solutions that continue to cater to millions of telecom subscribers.

I am reachable on multiple platforms including GitHub, LinkedIn and EMail.
