I'm highly intrigued by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the role it plays in solving customer problems.
Iâ€™m currently pursuing my Master's degree in AI to fuel my curiosity.

I'm a Solution Designer by profession with 12 years of experience. I've designed and implemented world-class inventory management and workflow-orchestration solutions that continue to cater to millions of telecom subscribers.

I am reachable on multiple platforms including GitHub, LinkedIn and EMail.
